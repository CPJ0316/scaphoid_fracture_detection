Phase 1: Faster R-CNN (ResNet-50-FPN)
Utilized Faster R-CNN (ResNet-50-FPN) with pretrained weights.
Fine-tuned the model using the dataset provided by the teaching assistant.

Phase 2: YOLOv11-OBB
Chose the OBB version of YOLOv11 to account for angle-aware detection.
Conducted experiments and selected the M model as the final choice.

Data Splitting
The dataset was divided into 80% for training and 20% for validation for fine-tuning.
